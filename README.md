# 🌿 Felipe Betancourt — Personal Creative Site

A personal website built with **React + Vite**, deployed on **GitHub Pages**.  
This project serves as a digital space where my **software projects**, **literary creations**, and **artistic or musical hobbies** coexist.

Inspired by the idea of a **personal laboratory**, the site evolves modularly — each section reflects a different part of my work, interests, and ongoing learning.
